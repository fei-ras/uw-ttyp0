VERSION INFORMATION

This is UW ttyp0, Version 2.1, 2025-09-14.



INTRODUCTION

This archive contains the source files and auxiliary programs for
installing the UW ttyp0 fonts.

UW ttyp0 is a family of monospaced bitmap fonts. It covers most of the
Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only Mkhedruli),
Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Tifinagh, Thai, Braille, most of
IPA (but no UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics,
line graphics and a few dingbats (about 3800 Unicode characters).

UW ttyp0 comes in eleven sizes (6x11, 6x12, 7x13, 7x14, 8x15, 8x16,
9x17, 9x18, 11x22, 14x30, 18x40). In all of the sizes there are regular
and bold versions; for 8x15/16, 9x17/18, 14x30, and 18x40 there is also
an italic. Two more sizes (28x60 and 36x80) can be generated by naive
scaling of the 14x30 and 18x40 fonts during the installation process.
(These fonts are intended only for high resolution displays. At low
resolutions, they are noticably blocky.)

The UW ttyp0 fonts are available in bdf, pcf, and otb format for X11,
and as console fonts for Linux, FreeBSD (vt and syscons), NetBSD, and
OpenBSD.
