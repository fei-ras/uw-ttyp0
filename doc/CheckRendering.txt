 1  To test whether the UW ttyp0 fonts have been correctly converted to
 2  PCF or OTB format and whether they are rendered correctly in terminal
 3  programs and editors, view this file using the Unicode version of
 4  UW ttyp0. (Note: The large rectangle character used in lines 22, 29,
 5  and 30 is located in the Unicode Private Use Area. Fonts different
 6  from UW ttyp0 may show a question mark, a small rectangle, or anything
 7  else instead. The same holds for the UW ttyp0 Linux console fonts.)

 9  Line 17 should show the letters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" with
10  a circumflex accent (^) on top of "o", "r", "u", and "x" and an
11  underline accent (_) below "b", "e", and "h" There should be no
12  accents anywhere else in lines 16, 17, or 18, and there should be
13  no spaces between the letters in line 17 or the equality signs in
14  lines 16 and 18.

24  Lines 29 and 30 should show four large rectangles touching each other
25  without horizontal or vertical gaps (Exception: If applications offer
26  the possibility to increase the interline spacing artificially, this
27  feature may lead to an intentional gap between line 29 and line 30.)
