UW TTYP0 CHANGE LOG


1.0    2012/08/28

       Initial public release.


1.1    2013/07/19

       Added 39 new characters (mostly Powerline symbols and other
       dingbats).

       Various stylistic changes, in particular digits 8 and dotted 0
       in bold fonts, mathematical relation symbols in 11x22, copyright
       symbols, musical symbols, chess symbols, card suit symbols.

       Changed code points of 7 characters in the PUA (E0A0-E0A1,
       E0B0-E0B3) to create space for Powerline symbols.

       Extended FAQ.


1.2    2013/08/01

       Changed copyright symbols in 8x16 (regular, bold, italic).

       Fixed some errors in FAQ and VARIANTS.dat.


1.3    2015/04/13

       Added 30 new characters (currency symbols, mathematical symbols,
       dingbats).

       Various stylistic changes, in particular lowercase "a" in 7x14
       regular and bold, Cyrillic uppercase Ef in 8x16 (regular, bold,
       italic), Greek lowercase Sigma and Upsilon in 7x14 bold, Greek
       lowercase Lambda and Chi in 11x22 bold, some currency symbols in
       9x18 bold and 11x22 regular and bold, some arrows in 7x14 bold
       and 9x18 bold, some mathematical quantifiers and operators.

       Changed glyph names for some arrow dingbats (U+27A1, U+27A5,
       U+27A6).


2.0    2025/09/07

       Added twelve new fonts (30, 30b, 30i, 40, 40b, 40i, 60, 60b, 60i,
       80, 80b, 80i). (Sizes 60 and 80 are obtained by naive scaling
       of sizes 30 and 40; these are intended only for high resolution
       displays.)

       Added support for font formats beyond pcf (otb and console
       fonts for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD), resulting in
       additional TARGETS_*.dat files. In order to make it possible to
       select a particular version in applications, the otb fonts are
       named "UW Ttyp0 OTB".

       Added about 695 characters (Latin, Cyrillic and Tifinagh
       letters, superscript letters, currency symbols, accents, arrows,
       geometrical shapes, dingbats, contextual variants for Thai vowel
       signs and tone marks, and Braille characters).

       Changed more than 100 characters stylistically (in one or more
       sizes and styles), in particular Digit 0 in 6x12 and 6x12b;
       uppercase "IJ" ligature, uppercase "SZ", and Abkhaz Ha in all
       fonts; Armenian lowercase Men in most fonts; Hebrew Vav and Yod
       in 11x22 and 11x22b; many geometrical shapes.

       Changed glyph names for one letter (U+0264), one arrow dingbat
       (U+27A1) and for raised accents in the Private Use Area.

       Moved some characters in the Private Use Area to other positions
       (the raised combining grave, acute, macron, diaeresis, and caron
       are now in the Adobe Corporate Use Area at U+F6xx, where there
       is a slightly larger chance that programs will make use of them).

       Added several options in VARIANTS.dat.

       Added 16 more legacy DOS encodings.

       Fixed, extended, and htmlized documentation files. 

       bdfmangle:
       Rewritten and extended.

       configure:
       Replaced "match" operator for "expr" by ":" to ensure compatibility
       with FreeBSD.

       configure:
       Used faketime (if installed) to ensure reproducible results.

       Makefile:
       Used -n option for gzip to ensure reproducible results.


2.1    2025/09/14

       bdftobsd:
       Fixed fallback encoding for NetBSD/OpenBSD console fonts that use
       DOS encodings beyond CP437 and CP850.

       Makefile.in and TARGETS_CONS_LINUX.dat:
       Added some 256-glyph console codesets for non-European languages
       that had been forgotten in v2.0.
       
       LinuxCodeSetSelector.html:
       Fixed the condition for a warning message concerning the African
       console codesets.

       bdfmangle:
       Fixed typo in comment.
