<h1>UW ttyp0: A Multiscript Monospaced Screen Font Family for X11
and the Linux and BSD Console</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>UW ttyp0 is a family of monospaced bitmap fonts. It covers most of the
Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only Mkhedruli),
Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Tifinagh, Thai, most of IPA (but no UPA),
Braille, standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line graphics
and a few dingbats.
</p>

<p>A monospaced bitmap font is obviously a bit of a dinosaur. I started to
work on the ASCII part of the 8x15 size in 1992 because I was dissatisfied
with the ugly misc-fixed fonts that came with X11; later more sizes,
styles and characters were added (with very long breaks in between). The
fonts are primarily intended for those old-fashioned computer users who
still do most of their work using old-fashioned terminal emulator
programs (like me): for programmers, system administrators, and Unix
power users. It's a workhorse – it's supposed to “look perfectly
normal”, or at least, as normal as possible given the constraints of
multiscript monospaced bitmap fonts. It's not supposed to be fancy, or
cool, or to attract any attention to itself.
</p>


<h2 id="sizesandstyles">Sizes and Styles</h2>

<p>UW ttyp0 comes in thirteen sizes (6x11, 6x12, 7x13, 7x14, 8x15, 8x16,
9x17, 9x18, 11x22, 14x30, 18x40, 28x60, 36x80). In all of the sizes there
are regular and bold versions; for 8x15/16, 9x17/18, and 14x30, 18x40,
28x60, and 36x80, there is also an italic. (Due to the relationship between
character height, character width, stroke width, and inter-character space,
italics do not really fit for the other sizes.) For Hebrew, italics are
replaced by semi-bold.  The regular styles (except for 11x22) and the
14x30/18x40/28x60/36x80 bold are sans-serifs with mostly constant stroke
width, with the obvious exception of some very narrow letters, such as
I, J, i, j, where serifs are unavoidable in a monowidth
font.
</p>

<p>The 28x60 and 36x80 fonts are obtained from the 14x30 and 18x40 fonts
by naive scaling using bdfresize. These fonts are intended only for high
resolution displays. At low resolutions, they are noticably blocky.
</p>

<p>The bold styles (except for 14x30/18x40/28x60/36x80) and the 11x22
regular have varying stroke width and they are hybrid serifs (there are
serifs on the horizontal strokes, but usually none on the vertical strokes).
This is unorthodox, but a consequence of the low resolution bitmap: A constant
stroke width of 2px would be much too dark for an 8x16 or 9x18 font, so
alternating between 1px strokes and 2px strokes is the only choice. But
then the contrast between thin and thick strokes is so large that serifs
on the thin (horizontal) lines become necessary for compensation. On the
other hand, for most letters, there is not enough horizontal space to
put decently looking serifs on the verticals. The form of the serifs
(slab or wedge) is uniform within one size/style, but varies between
different font sizes in order to create the right text color. For
Hebrew, both horizontal and vertical lines are boldened – if only the
horizontal lines were boldened, they would appear too light compared to
the other scripts.
</p>

<p>There are some spots in the bold fonts where I deviated from the
conventional distribution of thick and thin strokes. Examples include
the right leg of capital “U”, where a 1px stroke would have been too thin
for my taste, and the crossbar of capital “Ð”, where a 1px stroke would
not have been sufficiently visible. I've also used thick strokes for the
extenders of some lowercase Armenian letters, such as “գ”, “դ”, “ռ”, in
order to compensate for the fact that there was not enough space to make
these strokes sufficiently long.
</p>

<h2 id="scriptspecific">Script-specific Issues</h2>

<p>UW ttyp0 uses a relatively large x-height. For Latin and Cyrillic, this
should improve legibility; I hope that it's still acceptable for Greek.
For Armenian and Georgian, the x-height is reduced a bit; it is still
larger than it should be in a monoscript font, but in a multiscript
font, reducing it even more would be problematic.
</p>

<p>The odd sizes (6x11, 7x13, 8x15, 9x17) of UW ttyp0 are derived rather
mechanically from the corresponding even ones (6x12, 7x14, 8x16, 9x18),
usually by deleting the lowest pixel row. For the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek
and (unpointed) Hebrew script, this means that the vertical space
between two lines is reduced by one pixel, so it is rather unproblematic
(except for languages with a very high frequency of accents). The
Georgian and Armenian letters in UW ttyp0, however, have longer
descenders, so in these alphabets there is an actual compression of the
letter shapes. The results are not optimal. For pointed Hebrew,
Georgian, Armenian, and of course Thai, I'd strongly recommend the
even-sized versions.
</p>

<p>The Thai font is somewhat experimental – a 6x12 matrix is not really
sufficient for Thai, and even the 9x18 and 11x22 versions would benefit
from some additional vertical space. Moreover, UW ttyp0 is a bdf font
and the bdf format does not provide means for proper positioning of
floating accents, so Thai vowel signs and tone marks are implemented by
naive overprinting. The results are obviously not optimal. Contextual
variants of vowel signs and tone marks are provided in the Private
Use Area (both using the Windows XP encoding at U+F700-U+F71A and
using the MacOS encoding at U+F884-U+F89E); if applications are
able to make use of these, the output looks better. The overprinting
problem also affects the display of combining accents (which are
necessary for many non-European languages) and Hebrew vowel marks.
</p>

<h2 id="dubiousdesigndecisions">Dubious Design Decisions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Poor man's kerning:
  In some font sizes and styles, letters with high arms and without low
  arms (e.g., “F”, “Γ”) are moved to the right (compared to, say,
  “E”). This is intentional.

<li>Letter shapes:
  I have generally tried to stick to standard letter shapes as much as
  possible, but there are some exceptions. For instance, the crossbar of
  the small letter “f” (that is usually on x-height) is slightly
  lowered. This makes the glyph appear wider, so that it fits better
  into a monospaced font. Conversely, some Georgian letters (“დ”, “ლ”),
  that would otherwise be extremely wide, have glyphs with a reduced
  number of bowls. These forms are rarely used in print, but they are
  common both in handwriting and in typewriter fonts.

<li>Glyph collisions:
  There are some cases where a glyph collides with the following one.
  Most of these cases seem to be harmless, either because only one or
  two pixels of a glyph touch the neighbouring one (“Th” in 6x12 bold
  and 8x16 bold), or because the letter combination is rare (Cyrillic “шш”
  in 7x14 regular). There is one exception, namely the sequence “mm” in
  7x14 regular: the letter combination is frequent in some languages and
  the glyphs touch each other along the full length of the stem. Still I
  prefer this to a compressed or asymmetric “m”. (Unfortunately, in
  Armenian, the frequency of wide letters (“ա”, “խ”, “պ”, “տ”, “փ”) is
  so large that using compressed glyphs is unavoidable.)

<li>Turned letters:
  Some of the turned letters, such as “ɐ” or “ə”, differ from the
  non-turned versions. If the “e” of, say, 8x16 is turned, it would look
  very similar to an “a” (and vice versa), so some disambiguation is
  necessary.

<li>Diacritic marks:
  In certain font sizes and styles, the bitmap font designer has the
  choice between making the caron unnaturally small, making the breve
  unnaturally large, or displaying both in the same way. As there is
  usually little risk of confusion between the two (orthographies using
  both over the same letter are virtually non-existent), UW ttyp0 uses
  sometimes the same glyph for breve and caron. The same applies to
  cedilla and undercomma.

<li>Underline:
  Nowadays the underline character is no longer used for underlining,
  but for compound identifiers in programming languages and web
  addresses. For these applications, an underline character on the base
  line works better than an underline character below the base line.
  An alternative glyph (below the baseline and connecting on both sides)
  is available as an installation time option.

<li>ASCII non-alphanumerics:
  For the non-alphanumeric ASCII characters, UW ttyp0 uses mostly the
  “traditional Unix glyphs”: Tilde is raised, asterisk is centered, less
  and greater signs have a relatively large angle (which works better
  when these characters are used as a replacement for angular brackets,
  such as in HTML), the ASCII apostrophe is asymmetric and the ASCII
  grave is its mirror image. Alternative glyphs are available as an
  installation time option.
</ul>
